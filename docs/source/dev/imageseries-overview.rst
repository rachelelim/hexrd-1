ImageSeries
------------
Originally, hexrd could only process GE images. We developed the imageseries
package to allow for other image formats. The imageseries package provides a
standard interface for images coming from different sources. The idea is that
we could be working with a large number of images that we don't want to keep
in memory. Instead we load the images from a file or generate them dynamically,
but the interface is independent of the source.

See :ref:`examples` for an example of usage.

**Open and Write.**
The imageseries package has two main functions: open and write.

.. code-block:: python

    ims = imageseries.open(file, format, **kwargs)
    imageseries.write(ims, file, format, **kwargs):

The format refers to the source of the images; file and kwargs depend on the
format. Possible formats currently are:

``hdf5``
  The images are stored in an HDF5 file and loaded on demand.
  ``file`` is the name of the HDF5 file.

``frame-cache``
  The images are stored sparse matrices in a numpy .npz
  file; all of the sparse arrays are loaded on open, and a full (not sparse)
  array is delivered on request for a frame. There are two ways this can be
  done. In one, ``file`` is the name of the npz, and metadata is stored in the
  npz file. In the other, ``file`` is a YAML file that includes the name of
  the npz file as well as the metadata.

``image-files``
  The images are stored as one or more regular image files on
  the file system. ``file`` is a YAML file describing listing a sequence of
  image files and metadata.

``raw-image``
  This is for nonstandard or less common image formats that do not load with
  `fabio <https://pypi.org/project/fabio/>`. In that case, you can define
  your own data format. This ``file`` argument is a YAML file.

``array``
  images are stored as a 3D numpy array; used for testing. It takes no
  ``file`` argument, use ``None``.

See also :ref:`keyword-options`.

**Processed Imageseries.**
This is a subclass of imageseries. It has a number of built-in operations,
such as flipping, dark subtraction, restriction to a sub-rectangle, and
selecting frames. It can be further subclassed by adding more operations. It is
instantiated with an existing imageseries and a list of operations. When a
frame is requested, the processed imageseries gets the frame from the original
image series and applies the operations in order. It can then be saved as a
regular imageseries and loaded as usual.

For more detail, see :ref:`processed-ims`.

**Interface.**
The *imageseries* provides a standard interface for accessing images,
somewhat like a 3D array. Note that indexing does not work for slices or
multiple indices.

If ``ims`` is an imageseries instance:

* ``len(ims)`` is the number of frames
* ``ims[j]`` returns the j'th frame
* ``ims.shape`` is the shape of each frame
* ``ims.dtype`` is the numpy.dtype of each frame
* ``ims.metadata`` is a dictionary of metadata

**Stats module.**
This module delivers pixel by pixel stats on the imageseries. For each function
below, there is also a corresponding iterator that does the same thing, but
in smaller chunks.  The iterators are much better for median and percentiles,
which involve data for all frames.  See the API docs. Functions are:

* ``max(ims, nframes=0)`` gives a single image that is the max over all frames
  or a subset
* ``min(ims, nframes=0)`` gives a single image that is the min over all frames
  or a subset
* ``average(ims, nframes=0)`` gives the mean pixel value over all the frames
  or a subset
* ``median(ims, nframes=0)`` gives median
  or a subset
* ``percentile(ims, pct, nframes=0)`` gives the percentile over all frames
  or a subset

The median is typically used to generate background images, but percentile could also be used too.

Here is an example showing how to use the iterators.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    #  Using the standard function call
    img = stats.average(ims)

    # Using the iterable with 10 chunks
    for img in stats.average_iter(ims, 10):
        # update progress bar
        pass


**Omega module.**
For the HEDM work, we usually have a sequence of rotations about the vertical
axis. Omega refers to the angle of rotation. The ``OmegaImageSeries`` is a
subclass that has metadata for the rotation angles.

See :ref:`omega`.
